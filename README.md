Very simple program to simulate the use of flashcards within the command line.

# Reason for making this
Use quizlet and was charged to create more than a couple sets of flashcards

# How to use
Compile the program with your favorite C++ compiler,
Type your question entries in a file named "questions.txt" seperated by newlines in the same directory
Type your answer entries in a file named "answers.txt" seperated by newlines, also in the same directory

Feel free to share and modify the code to your liking.
Planning to slowly add features throughout the rest of the year.
